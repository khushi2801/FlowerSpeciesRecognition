# FlowerSpeciesRecognition

A mini project using Machine Learning

Flower Species Recognition project can predict the species of the given flower. The iris dataset is used to train the models. 
The dataset has 150 instances (50 in a row) and 4 attributes namely sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. 
The trained models can predict the species of the given flower on the basis of its characteristics.
